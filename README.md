Here i use AVL tree to print tree as real root 
As it easy to be traced

       /            \
    ___60_      ___95__
   /      \    /       \
  _50_   70_   90_   100__
 /    \     \     \       \
 30  55    77    93     110

C++ helped me to write this algorithm 
so if you don't have experiance with it you can download mingw on windows and setup it
then write this command 
$ g++ main.cpp -o main 
$ main

Oooh here you go :)
Hope you enjoy it
